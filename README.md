# **PyCitySchools District Analysis** 
This analysis aimed to assist Maria with gathering testing data for high schools. The demographic for the school are students in grades nine through twelve to uphold grades and uncover trends of cheating. We will be voiding scores out as NaN for math for the ninth-grade students. This dataset reviewed the results for two major groups: mathematics. Below, we will dive into research and explanation for our findings. 

## Results For PyCity School Distrct 
## District Summary:
- The reason behind this data review is to ensure the accuracy of funding is going to the school district. 
 As grades influenced by cheating are inaccurate. These inaccuracies affect the school's funding based on
 student performance. As high grades will indicate higher school ranking, they will get funding over more 
 honest schools that have ranked lower. With this data we can insure accurate school rankings, as well updated 
 Charter vs Distrct ranking. 

## Corrected statistics  
- The correct data shows the school ranking correctly. As you can see below, the incorrect data has been replaced with the NaN, 
as previously disclosed earlier in the project summary. Thomas High School is the only outliyer with results that have been correct. 
```
                       9th,	10th	11th	12th
Rodriguez High School	81.0	80.6	80.9	80.4

Wright High School	83.8	83.8	84.2	84.1

### Scores by school type:
- With the newly updated scores we can average the data for grades, average reading, and passing rate(s)
to reflect accurate information. As well as updated data charts showing charter school passing rates and scores vs. district.

## Conclusion 
Although Thomas School is the most impacted by the updates in the ninth-grade scores. We are not showing reflected schools as deserved. 
We no longer have inaccurate and inflated numbers, representing the districts better. All this data is reflecting 
updated schools with  NaN accurate set for 9th-grade scores and unadjusted 10th-12th grade: This will ensure accurate data for funding, school ranking.
